# Wire-Bender
This is a work in progress super compact 3D printed Wire Bender. Works best with SLA Resin printers, I tested it with a 1mm and a 0.6mm Wire but it should be capable to do up to 2mm with the right printing material and a sufficiently powerful stepper motor. 

I also wrote a python script that should takes in a mathematical formula such as a complex spiral shape and generates g-code to approximate the shape. 

Unfortunately, my project priorities shifted and I no longer need this Bender at the moment and did never get a chance to test the script. Also the script likely needs some offset values to account for spring back and clearances.
At the moment I have only the Inventor files and ipt files.

If you are interested in working with this bender, feel free to make an issue, I'll see what I can do. 

You are free to use these files in any way you want.
